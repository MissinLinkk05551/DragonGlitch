Neon-bright accents: Colors like electric blue, vibrant green, and fiery red are used strategically to highlight code elements and make them stand out. This adds visual interest and aids in code comprehension.
Glowing glitch effect: Subtle glitch-style animations or distortions might be incorporated, adding a dynamic and futuristic feel. This could manifest in the cursor, highlighting, or even within the code itself.
